My current system. It is a work in progress and will be modularized later. For now this is it.
I do not Intend to use home-manager if I can help it. I will probably end up using stow at some point but I need to fix a few things and learn a bit more.
I'm trying to keep this build simple so that it can be copied by people like myself who are learning but still want something that looks nice.
