My current NixOS config.
This is a work in progress and will be modularized later...I'm not sure when exactly.
I do not Intend to use home-manager if I can help it. I will probably end up using stow at some point, but
I need to fix a few things and learn a bit more. Home-manager would probably be easier,
especially for someone just getting in to this so if you are new or don't particularly see yourself
deep diving into this, I do not discourage you.
There are some files set up with home-manager in mind and I want to keep those for the people who may use it.
But I'm personally not a fan and would prefer to at least try to figure out how to creat modules for
the config myself. Probably not smart but for now this is my choice. Hopefully by the time I'm done,
this will be a cohesive flake (maybe with an install script) or cromulent template for those getting started.

A LOT of what I have done is thanks to the NixOS forums, r/NixOS, r/Unixporn, and many other forums/users
who have either had trouble themselves or been kind enough to post their rice. Most of the themeing in 
fact was based on RedaKadri's .dots in r/Unixporn. Big thanks to him as the gtk portion was killing me.
If you're new to this and have found my .dots I wish you the best and hope what I have here can help.

If you run into issues the best thing I can recommend is browsing forums and joining a discord.
Tyller Kelley the creator of ZaneyOS (a VERY good flake that I have used and would absolutely recommend)
has an excellent discord that has helped me a handfull of times.
